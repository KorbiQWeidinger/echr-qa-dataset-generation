European Court of Human Rights  6/57  Last update: 31.08.2023  I.  General considerations  
 
Article 2 of the Convention  
“1.  Everyone ’s right to life shall be protecte d by law. No one shall be deprived of his life intentionally 
save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty 
is provided by law.  
2.  Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results 
from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:  
(a)  in defence of any person from unlawful violence;  
(b)  in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;  
(c)  in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.”

A.  Interpretation of Article 2  
1.  The Court ’s approach to the interpretation of Article 2 must be guided by the fact that the object 
and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings 
requires that its provisions must be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective ( McCann and Others  v. the United Kingdom , 1995, § 146). 
2.  Article 2 ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention, one which in peace 
time, admits  of no derogation under Article 15. Together with Article 3, it enshrines one of the basic 
values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe ( Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy  [GC], 
2011, § 174). As such, its provisions must be strictly construed ( McCann and Others  v. the United 
Kingdom , 1995, § 147). 
B.  State obligations under Article 2  
3.  Article 2  contains two substantive obligations: the general obligation to protect by law the right to 
life, and the prohibition of intentional deprivation of life, delimited by a list of exceptions ( Boso  v. Italy  
(dec.), 2002). Having regard to its fundamental character, Article 2 of the Convention also contains a 
procedural obligation to carry out an effective investigation into alleged breaches of its substantive limb ( Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom  [GC], 2016, § 229).  
C.  Applicability of Article 2 in near death situations  
4.  The Court has emphasised on many occasions that Article 2 of the Convention may come into play 
even if a person whose right to life was allegedly breached did not die. In particular, the Court has held that in exceptional circumstances, depending on considerations such as the degree and type of force us ed and the nature of the injuries, use of force  by State agents which does not result in death "

European Court of Human Rights  7/57 Last update: 31.08.2023  may disclose a violation of Article 2 of the Convention, if the behavio ur of the State agents, by its very 
nature, puts the applicant ’s life at serio us risk  even  though  the latter survives ( Makaratzis  v. Greece  
[GC] , 2004, § 55; Soare and Others  v. Romania, 2011, §§ 108-109; Trévalec  v. Belgium , 2011, §§ 55-
61). In all other cases where a person is assaulted or ill- treated by State agents, their complaints will 
rather fall to be examined under Article 3 of the Convention  (Makaratzis  v. Greece  [GC] , 2004, § 51; 
İlhan v. Turkey  [GC] , 2000, § 76). In cases concerning applicants who survived a potentially lethal 
attack by non -State actors, the Court has adopted a similar approach to the one taken in respect of 
cases concerning use of force by State agents ( Yotova  v. Bulgaria, 2012, § 69). 
5.  The Court has also found the allegations of persons suffering from serious illnesses to fall under 
Article 2 of the Convention  when the circumstances potentially engaged the responsibility of the State  
(L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom , 1998,  §§ 36-41, concerning an applicant suffering from leukaemia; G.N. 
and Others  v. Italy , 2009, concerning applicants suffering from a potentially life -threatening disease, 
hepatitis; Hristozov and Others  v. Bulgaria, 2012, concerning applicants suffering from different  forms  
of terminal canc er; Oyal  v. Turkey , 2010, in which the applicant had been infected with the HIV virus, 
which endangered his life ; Aftanache  v. Romania, 2020, § 53, where the medical personnel refused to 
administer the usual insulin treatment to a diabetic in  a precarious condition  and a contrario  Brincat 
and Others  v. Malta, 2014, § 84, where the Court considered that Article 2 did not apply to the 
applicants, former employees of a Government -run ship repair yard, who had been exposed to 
asbestos, since their current health conditions were neither an inevitable precursor to the diagnosis 
of a rare cancer associated with asbestos exposure nor life -threatening) . 
6.  The Court has also examined, on the merits, allegations made under Article 2 by persons claiming 
that their life was at risk, although n o such risk had yet materialised , when it was persuaded that there 
had been a serious threat to their lives ( R.R. and Others  v. Hungary , 2012, §§ 26-32, where the 
applicants complained of having been excluded from a witness protection program me; Makuchyan 
and Minasyan v. Azerbaijan and Hungary , 2020, §§ 93-94 where  the perpetrator threatened to kill the 
applicant whilst trying to break down the  door of his room with an axe ; and, by contrast , Selahattin 
Demirtaş  v. Turkey , 2015, §§ 30-36, where the applicant complained that a newspaper article had put 
his life at risk).  
7.  Likewise, in cases concerning potentially lethal accidents ( Alkın  v. Turkey , 2009, § 29; Çakmakçı  
v. Turkey  (dec. ), 2017, § 32; Fergec v. Croatia , 2017, §§ 21-24; Kotelnikov  v. Russia , 2016, § 98; Cavit 
Tınarlıoğlu  v. Turkey , 2016, § 67; Marius Alexandru and Marinela Ștefan v. Romania, 2020, § 75), or 
environmental disasters ( Kolyadenko and Others  v. Russia , 2012, § 155), the Court has examined 
under Article 2 of the Convention the complaints of the applicant who had fortuitously survived the 
incident . The principle is th at in such situations Article 2 applies either if (a) the activity at issue was 
dangerous by its very nature and put  the life of the people concerned at real and imminent risk , or if 
(b) the injur ies suffered by them were seriously life-threatening . The assessment of the relevant risk 
or injury depends on various factors ( Nicolae Virgiliu Tănase  v. Romania [GC] , 2019, §§ 139-145). 
8.  In Jeanty  v. Belgium , 2020, where a detainee with  psychological difficulties  failed in his numerous 
attempts to commit suicide, the Court considered that Article 2 was applicable in the circumstances of the case, irrespective of the fact that the injuries he had sustained were not serious, in view of the 
nature of the action at issue which put the applicant ’s life at a real and imminent risk ( § 62). 
9.  In fact, the Court has recently underlined that  Article 2 also comes into play in situations where the 
person concerned was the victim of an activity or conduct, whether public or private, which by its nature put his or her life at real and imminent risk and he or she has suffered injuries that appear life -
threatening as they occur, even though he or she ultimately survived ( Tërshana v. Albania, 2020, 
§ 132;  Lapshin v. Azerbaijan, 2021, § 71). "

European Court of Human Rights  8/57  Last update: 31.08.2023  II.  Protection of life 
 
Article 2 § 1 of the Convention 
“1.  Everyone ’s right to life shall be protected by law. ...”  
HUDOC keywords  
Positive obligations (2) – Life (2 -1) 
 
A.  The nature of the positive obligations of the State  
10.  Article 2 § 1 enjoins the State not only to refrain from the intentional and unlawful taking of life 
but also to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction ( Centre for 
Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], 2014, § 130). In broad terms, this 
positive obligation has two aspects: (a) the duty to provide a regulatory framework ; and (b) the 
obligation to take preventive operational measures.  
B.  The scope of the positive obligations of the State 
11.  The Cou rt has found  the positive obligation under Article 2 to take appropriate steps to safeguard 
the lives of those within its jurisdiction to apply in the context of any activity, whether public or not, 
in which the right to life may be at stake ( Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu  
v. Romania [GC], 2014, § 130). 
12.  Thus, the Court has found positive obligations to arise under Article 2 in a number of different 
contexts, such as, for example:  
 in the context of healthcare ( Calvelli and Ciglio  v. Italy  [GC], 2022 ; Vo v. France  [GC] , 2004 ); 
 in the context of dangerous activities, including industrial or environmental disasters 
(Öneryıldız  v. Turkey  [GC], 2004 ; Budayeva and Others  v. Russia, 2008,; Kolyadenko and 
Others  v. Russia , 2012, ; Brincat and Others  v. Malta , 2014 ; M. Özel and Others  v. Turkey , 
2015); 
 in the context of incidents on board a ship ( Leray and Others  v. France  (dec.), 2001) , on trains 
(Kalender  v. Turkey , 2009 ), on a construction site ( Pereira Henriques  v. Luxembourg, 2006) , 
at a playground ( Koceski  v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (dec.), 2013 ); or at a 
school ( Ilbeyi Kemaloğlu and Meriye Kemaloğlu v. Turkey , 2012 ); 
 in the context of road safety ( Rajkowska  v. Poland (dec.), 2007 ; Anna Todorova  v. Bulgaria, 
2011); the provision of emergency services ( Furdí k v. Slovakia  (dec.), 2008 ); or diving 
operations in deep sea ( Vilnes and Others  v. Norway , 2013);  
 in the context of medical  care and assistance given to vulnerable persons institutionalis ed in 
State facilities ( Nencheva and Others  v. Bulgaria, 2013; Centre for Legal Resources on behalf 
of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], 2014 ; Dumpe  v. L atvia (dec.), 201 ). 
 In the context of the State’s failure to properly secure an area mined by the military ( Paşa 
and Erkan Erol  v. Turkey , 2006 ; Albekov and Others  v. Russia , 2008); to secure and supervise  
a firing range containing unexploded ordonance ( Oruk  v. Turkey , 2014 ); and to re act 
prom ptly to a disappearance in life -threatening circumstances ( Osmanoğlu v. Turkey , 2008 ; 
Dodov  v. Bulgaria, 2008 ). "

European Court of Human Rights  9/57 Last update: 31.08.2023   In the context of  an operation  to rescue migrants  who were drowning while trying to cross 
borders at sea ( Safi and Others  v. Greece , 2022) or a river ( Alhowais  v. Hungary , 2023).  
13.  In a case  where the applicant ’s husband died after being hit by a tree in a health resort, the Court 
has held that the State’s duty to safeguard the right to life extended to the taking of reasonable 
measures to ensure the safety of individuals in public places ( Ciechońska v. Poland, 2011, § 67). 
14.  However, the Court has underlined, many times, that Article 2 of the Convention cannot be 
interpreted as guaranteeing to every individual an absolute level of security in any activity in which 
the right to life may be at stake, in particular when the person concerned bears a degree of 
responsibility for the  accident having exposed hi mself  or herself to unjustified danger ( Molie  
v. Romania (dec.), 2009, § 44; Koseva  v. Bulgaria  (dec.) , 2010;  Gōkdemir  v. Turkey  (dec.) , 2015, § 17; 
Çakmak  v. Turkey  (dec.), 2017).  
15.  Nonetheless, i n the very particular context  of detention, the Court has held that there are certain 
basic precautions which the authorities are expected to take in all cases in order to minimise any 
potential risk to protect the health and well -being of persons deprived of their liberty ( Daraibou  
v. Croatia , 2023,  § 84 and the cases cited therein ). 
C.  Protection of life in context  
16.  As mentioned above, the positive obligations of the State arise in different contexts, some of 
which are referred to  below.  
1.  Protection of persons from lethal use of force by non -State actors  
17.  The Court has held that Article 2 of the Convention implies in certain well -defined circumstances 
a positive obligation on the authorities to  take preventive operational measures to protect an 
individual whose life is at risk from the criminal acts of another individual ( Osman v. the United 
Kingdom , 1998, § 115;  Branko Tomaši ć and Others  v. Croatia , 2009, § 50). 
18.  However, bearing in mind the difficulties involved in policing modern societies, the 
unpredictability of human conduct and the operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources, such an obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an 
impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities. Accordingly, for the Court not every claimed 
risk to life can entail for the authorities a Convention requirement to take operational measures to 
prevent that risk from materialising ( Osman  v. the United Kingdom , 1998, § 116; Choreftakis and 
Choreftaki  v. Greece , 2012, § 46). 
19.  In this respect, the Court takes into consideration the need to ensure that the police exercise their 
powers to control and prevent crime in a manner which fully respects the due process and other guarantees which legitimately place restraints on the scope of their action to investigate crime and 
bring offenders to justice, including the guarantees contained in Articles 5 and 8  of the Convention 
(Osman v. the United Kingdom , 1998, § 116).  
20.  For a positive obligation to arise it must be established that the authorities knew or ought to have 
known  at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual 
or individuals from the criminal acts of a third party and that they failed to take measures within the 
scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might  have been expected to avoid that risk 
(Mastromatteo  v. Italy  [GC] , 2002, § 68; 
Paul and Audrey Edwards  v. the United Kingdom , 2002, § 55). 
21.  In this regard, the Court has underlined that the duty to take preventive operational measures 
under Article 2 is an obligation of means, not of result. Thus, in circumstances where the competent 
authorities hav e become aware of a real and immediate risk to life triggering their duty to act, and 
have responded to the identified risk by taking appropriate measures within their powers in order to "

European Court of Human Rights  10/57 Last update: 31.08.2023  prevent that risk from materialising, the fact that such measures may  nonetheless fail to achieve the 
desired result is not in itself capable of justifying the finding of a violation under this head. On the 
other hand, the Court observes that in this context, the assessment of the nature and level of risk constitutes an int egral part of the duty to take preventive operational measures where the presence 
of a risk so requires. Thus, an examination of the State ’s compliance with this duty under Article 2 
must comprise an analysis of both the adequacy of the assessment of risk conducted by the domestic authorities and, where a relevant risk triggering the duty to act was or ought to have been identified, 
the adequacy of the preventive measures taken  (Kurt  v. Austria  [GC] , 2021, § 160). 
22.  For the Court it is sufficient for an applicant to show that the authorities did not do all that could 
be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they hav e or ought 
to have knowledge. This question in its view could only be answered in the light of all the 
circumstances of the case at hand ( Osman  v. the United Kingdom , 1998, § 116). Moreover, the Court 
must be cautious about revisiting events with the wisdom of hindsight . This means that a given case 
in which a real and immediate risk materialised must be assessed from the point of view of what was 
known to the competent authorities at the relevant time.  (Kurt  v. Austria  [GC], 2021, § 160).  
23.  If the Court considers  that it has not been established that the authorities knew or ought to have 
know n at the relevant time of the existence of a risk which was both real and immediate, no obligation 
would be triggered to take preventive operation al measures in that regard ( Kurt  v. Austria  [GC], 2021, 
§ 211; see also Derenik Mkrtchyan and Gayane Mkrtchyan v. Armenia , 2021, §§ 59-60, which 
concerned the death of a child  of ten years  with pre -existing health issues, during a fight with his peers 
in class while the teacher was absent ; Tagiyeva v. Azerbaijan, 2022, §§ 60-66, where a well- known 
writer and columnist, who had a fatwa issued against him several years prior t o the events in Iran, was 
fatally stabbed by an unknown person and Fernandes de Oliveira v. Portugal  [GC], 2019, § 131-132, 
albeit in a different context, namely suicide ). 
24.  The Court has considered the State to have an  obligation to take preventive operational measures 
to protect one or more individuals identifiable in advance as the potential target of a lethal act in 
contexts such as:  
 murder of a prisoner ( Paul and Audrey Edwards  v. the United Kingdom , 2002, §57);  
 domestic violence ( Branko Tomaši ć and Others  v. Croatia , 2009, §§ 52-53; Opuz  v. Turkey , 
2009, § 129; Tkhelidze  v. Georgia , 2021, § 57; A and B  v. Georgia, 2022, § 49); 
 protection of witnesses  in criminal proceedings ( Van Colle  v. the United Kingdom , 2012, and 
A and B  v. Romania, 2020, § 118); 
 killing of individuals in a conflict zone ( Kılıç v. Turkey , 2000, § 63; 
Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey , 
2000, § 88); 
 killing of a conscript during military service ( Yabansu and Others  v. Turkey , 2013, § 91). 
 kidnapping of an individual ( Olewnik -Cieplińska and Olewnik  v. Poland, 2019, § 125). 
25.  The Court has also applied the aforementioned principles to cases giving rise to an  obligation to 
afford general protection to society in certain specific contexts, such as:  
 murder committed by convicts on prison leave or placed under  a semi -custodial regime 
(Mastromatteo  v. Italy  [GC] , 2002, § 69); 
 killing by convicted murderer following his release on licence ( Choreftakis and Choreftaki  
v. Greece , 2012, §§ 48-49); 
 killing by an off- duty police officer ( Gorovenky and Bugara v. Ukraine , 2012, § 32); 
 murder of a lawyer by her client ’s mentally disturbed husband ( Bljakaj and Others  v. Croatia ,

European Court of Human Rights  11/57 Last update: 31.08.2023  26.  In a recent case the authorities did not  preventively confiscate a gun from a student whose 
internet postings prior to committing school killings, while not containing specific threats, cast doubt 
on his fitness to safely possess a firearm . The Court has laid emphasis on the fact that the use of 
firearms entails a high level of inherent risk to life  and that therefore the State had to put in place and 
rigorously apply a system of adequate and effective safeguards designed to counteract and prevent any improper and dangerous use of such weapons ( Kotilainen and Others  v. Finland, 2020, § 88). 
27.  The case of Ribche va and Others  v. Bulgaria, 2021,  concerned the death of a law -enforcement 
officer during a planned operation . The Court  considered that, when deciding to involve the 
applicants ’ relative in the operation in his capacity as a specialised officer tasked with dealing with 
dangerous individuals, the authorities had a positive duty to do what could reasonably be expected of 
them to protect him from the risks of such an operation. In t his respect, drawing on its well- established 
case -law, the Court emphasised that the standard of reasonableness in relation to this positive  
obligation (Article 2 § 1) was not as stringent as that in respect of the negative  obligation (Article 2 
§ 2) to re frain from using force “more than absolutely necessary” (a strictly proportionate use of force 
excluding any margin of appreciation). Rather, the scope and content of the positive operational obligation at issue had to be defined in a way which does not im pose an impossible or disproportionate 
burden on the authorities given the choices they face (priorities and resources) and given the unpredictability of human conduct ( § 165) . On the basis of the information contained in the case -file, 
the Court found tha t, while the authorities had made mistakes in the planning and execution of the 
operation, the steps they had taken to minimise the risk to the officer ’s life were reasonable (§ 180). 
28.  In a recent domestic violence case where the applicants ’ relative was killed by her husband, from 
whom she had been de facto  separated for three years and who had been harassing her for  nine  
months , the Court  found that the authorities failed to respond immediately to the comp laints of the 
deceased, save on one occasion , and failed to carry out any proactive, autonomous, and 
comprehensive risk assessment having regard to  the context of domestic violence. It considered that,  
had the authorities carried out such a risk assessment , they would have appreciated that there was a 
real and immediate risk to the life of the applicants ’ relative and they could have taken various steps , 
including ensuring proper coordination amongst themselves, to avert the risk to her life . The only 
preve ntive measure undertaken by the authorities, namely, protective orders remained without any 
tangible effect. Therefore, given the circumstances  in the case, the authorities failed to take adequate 
preventive measures  to protect the life of the applicants ’ relative  (Y and Others  v. Bulgaria, 2022, 
§§ 91-110; see also Landi  v. Italy , 2022, where the authorities ’ failure to take preventive action against 
recurrent domestic violence led to the applicant’s attempted murder by her partner and to the murder 
of their son).  
2.  Protection of persons from self -harm  
29.  The Court has held that Article 2 may imply in certain well- defined circumstances a positive 
obligation on the part of the authorities to take preventive operational measures  in particular 
circumstances  to protect an indi vidual from himself or herself (Renolde  v. France , 2008, § 81). 
30.  In particular, persons in cust ody are in a vulnerable position and  the authorities are under a duty 
to protect them ( Keenan v. the United Kingdom , 2001, § 91). The prison authorities, similarly, must 
discharge their duties in a manner compatible with the rights an d freedoms of the individual 
concerned. There are general measure s and precautions available to diminish the opportunities for 
self- harm, without infringing personal autonomy. Whether any more stringent measures are 
necessary in respect of a prisoner and w hether it is reasonable to apply them will depend on the 
circumstances of the case ( Renolde  v. France , 2008, § 83). 
31.  Likewise, in the c ontext of  individuals carrying out  military service , the Court has underlined that, 
as with persons in custody, conscripts  and contractual military servicemen, whose conditions of life 
and service correspond to those of conscripts,  are within the exclusive control of the authorities of "

Mosendz  v. Ukraine , 2013, § 92; Boychenko  v. Russia , 2021, § 80). 
32.  Persons with mental disabilities are considered to constitute a particularly  vulnerable group who 
require  protection from self -harm (Renolde  v. France , 2008, § 84 and S.F.  v. Switzerland, 2020, § 78). 
33.  In particular, the authorities have a general operational duty to take reasonable measures to 
prevent a person from self -harm, irrespective of whether there has been voluntary or involuntary 
hospitalisation s. In this respect, the specific measures required wi ll depend on the particular 
circumstances of the case, and those specific circumstances will often differ depending on whether 
the patient is volunta rily or involuntarily hospitalis ed. However, in the case of patients who are 
hospitalised following a judic ial order, and therefore involuntarily, the Court, in its own assessment, 
may apply a stricter standard of scrutiny ( Fernandes de Oliveira v. Portugal  [GC], 2019, § 124).  
34.  Ultimately, for a positive oblig ation to arise where the risk to a person derives from self -harm, 
such as a suicide in custody  or in a psychiatric hospital, it must be established that the authorities 
knew or ought to have known at the time of the exist ence of a real and immediate risk to the life of 
an identified individual and, if so, that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers 
which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk ( Younger  v. the United Kingdom  
(dec.), 2003 ; Fernandes de Oliveira v. Portugal  [GC], 2019, § 110). 
35.  In order to establish whether the authorities knew or ought to have known that the life of a 
particular individual was subject to a real and immediate risk, triggering the duty to take appropriate preventive measures , the Court takes into account a number of factors, including: i) whether the 
person had a history of mental health problems; ii) the gravity of the mental condition; iii) previous attempts to commit suicide or self -harm; iv) suicidal thoughts or threats ; and v) signs of physical or 
mental distress (Fernandes de Oliveira v. Portugal  [GC], 2019, § 115 and Boychenko  v. Russia , 2021, 
§ 80). 
36.  Moreover, the Court also reiterates that the obligation to protect the health and well- being of 
persons in detention clearly encompasses an obligation to protect the life of arrested and detained 
persons from a foreseeable danger ( Eremiášová and Pechová v. the Czech Republic (revision), 2013, 
§ 117; Keller  v. Russia , 2013, § 88). 
37.  The duty to take preventive operational measures has arisen so far mainly  in the following 
contexts:  
 detention in custody  or in prison ( Trubnikov  v. Russia , 2005 ; Akdoğdu v. Turkey , 2005 ; De 
Donder and De Clippel  v. Belgium , 2011;  Ketreb  v. France , 2012 ; Volk  v. Slovenia
, 2012 ; Mitić  
v. Serbia , 2013 ; Keller  v. Russia , 2013 ; S.F. v. Switzerl and, 2020) ; 
 compulsory military service ( Kılınç and Others  v. Turkey , 2005 ; Ataman v. Turkey , 2006 ; 
Perevedentsevy  v. Russia , 2014 ; Malik Babayev  v. Azerbaijan, 2017 ) or contractual military 
service (Boychenko  v. Russia , 2021). 
 voluntary/involuntary psychiatric care ( Reynolds  v. the United Kingdom , 2012 ; Fernandes de 
Oliveira  v. Portugal  [GC] , 2019 ; Hiller  v. Austria , 2016 ). 
38.  In a case where the applicant ’s wife set  herself on fire in protest at a forced eviction, the Court 
held that, in a situation where an individual threatens to take his or her own life in plain view of State 
agents and, moreover, where this threat is an emotional reaction directly induced  by the State agents ’ 
actions or demands, the latter should treat this threat with the utmost seriousness as constituting an imminent risk to that individual’s life, regardless of how unexpected that threat might have been. In such circumstances, if the St ate agents become aware of such a threat sufficient ly in advance, a 
positive obligation arises under Article 2 requiring them to prevent  this threat from materialising  by 
any means which are reasonable and feasible in the circumstances ( Mikayil Mammadov  v. Azerbaijan, 
2009, § 115).  "

European Court of Human Rights  13/57 Last update: 31.08.2023  3.  Protection of persons from environmental or industrial disasters  
39.  In the context of industrial activities, which the Court has deemed to be by their very nature 
dangerous, the Court has placed a special emphasis on regulations geared to the special features of 
the activity in question, particularly with regard to the lev el of the potential risk to human lives. It 
considered that they must govern the licensing, setting up, operation, security and supervision of the 
activity and must make it compulsory for all those concerned to take practical measures to ensure the 
effecti ve protection of citizens whose lives might be en dangered by the inherent risks.  
40.  Among these preventive measures, a particular weight should be placed on the public ’s right to 
information, as established in the case -law of the Convention institutions and relevant regulations 
must also provide for appropriate procedures, taking into account the technical aspects of the activity in question, for identifying shortcomings in the processes concerned and any errors committed by those responsible at different levels ( Öneryıldız  v. Turkey  [GC] , 2004, § 90; Budayeva and Others  
v. Russia , 2008, § 132; Kolyadenko and Others  v. Russia , 2012, § 159). 
41.  As to the choice of particular practical measures, the Court has consistently held that where the 
State is required to take positive measures, the choice of means is in principle a matter that falls within 
the Contracting State’s margin of appreciation. There are different avenues to ensure Convention 
rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular measure  provided by domestic law, it 
may still fulfil its positive duty by other means. In this respect an impossible or disproportionate 
burden must not be imposed on the authorities without consideration being given, in particular, to 
the operational choices wh ich they must make in terms of priorities and resources; this results from 
the wide margin of appreciation States enjoy, as the Court has previously held, in difficult social and 
technical spheres ( Budayeva and Others  v. Russia , 2008, §§ 134-135; Vilnes and Others  v. Norway , 
2013, § 220; Brincat and Others  v. Malta, 2014, § 101).  
42.  In assessing whether the respondent State complied with its positive obligation, the Court must 
consider the particular circums tances of the case, regard being had, among other elements, to the 
domestic legality of the authorities ’ acts or omissions, the domestic decision -making process, 
including the appropriate investigations and studies, and the complexity of the issue, especia lly where 
conflicting Convention interests are involved. The scope of the positive obligations imputable to the 
State in the particular circumstances would depend on the origin of the threat and the extent to which 
one or the other risk is susceptible to mitigation ( Budayeva and Others  v. Russia , 2008, §§ 136-137; 
Kolyadenko and Others  v. Russia , 2012, § 161). 
43.  Whenever a State undertakes or organises dangerous activities, or authorises them, it must 
ensure through a system of rules and through sufficient control that the risk is reduced to a reasonable minimum ( Mučibabić v. Serbia , 2016, § 126) . If nevertheless damage arises, it will only amount to a 
breach of the State’ s positive obligations if it was due to insufficient regulations or insufficient control, 
but not if the damage was caused through the negligent  conduct of an individual or a  concatenation 
of unfortunate events ( Stoyanovi  v. Bulgaria, 2010, § 61). 
44.  More detailed informa tion can be found in the Case -Law Guide on the Environment . 
4.  Protection of persons in the context of healthcare  
a.  General population  
45.  In the context of healthcare, the positive obligations require States to make regulations 
compelling hospitals, whether private or public, to adopt appropriate measures for the protection of patients ’ lives ( Calvelli and Ciglio  v. Italy  [GC] , 2022, § 49; Vo v. France  [GC] , 2004, § 89; Lopes de Sousa 
Fernandes  v. Portugal  [GC] , 2017, § 166). "

TURQUIE""}","Guide on Article 2  of the Convention –  Right to life  
European Court of Human Rights  14/57 Last update: 31.08.2023  46.  In this connection, the States ’ obligation to regulate must be understood in a broader sense which 
includes the d uty to ensure the effective functioning of that regulatory framework. The regulatory 
duties thus encompass necessary measures to ensure implementation, including supervision and 
enforcement ( Lopes de Sousa Fernandes  v. Portugal  [GC] , 2017, § 190).  
47.  However, the question whether there has been a failure by the State in its regulatory duties calls 
for a concrete assessment of the alleged deficiencies rather than an abstract  one. Therefore, the mere 
fact that the regulatory framework may be deficient in some respect is not sufficient in itself to raise 
an issue under Article 2 of the Convention. It must be shown to have operated to the patient ’s 
detriment ( Lopes de Sousa Fernandes  v. Portugal  [GC] , 2017, § 188). 
48.  The Court has underlined that even in cases where medical negligence was established, it would 
normally find a substantive violation of Article 2 only if the relevant regulatory framework failed to 
ensure proper protection of the patient’s life ( Lopes de Sousa Fernandes  v. Portugal  [GC] , 2017, § 187). 
In th is connection, the Court considered that where a Contracting State has made adequate provision 
for securing high professional standards among health professionals and the protection of the lives of 
patients, matters such as an error of judgment on the part  of a health professional or negligent 
coordination among health professionals in the treatment of a particular patient cannot be considered 
sufficient of themselves to call a Contracting State to account from the standpoint of its positive obligations und er Article 2 of the Convention to protect life ( Powell  v. the United Kingdom  (dec.), 2000 ; 
Dodov  v. Bulgaria, 2008, § 82; Kudra v. Croatia , 2012, § 102;  Lopes de Sousa Fernandes  v. Portugal  
[GC] , 2017, § 187).  
49.  However, it has not excluded the possibility that the acts and omissions of the authorities in the 
context of public health policies, may, in certain circumstances, engage the Contacting Parties ’ 
responsibility under the substantive limb of Article 2 ( Powell  v. the United Kingdom  (dec.), 2000 ) and 
that an issue may arise under Article 2 where it is shown that the authoriti es of a Contracting State 
have put an individual ’s life at risk through the denial of the health care which they have undertaken 
to make available to the population generally ( Cyprus  v. Turkey  [GC],  2001, § 219; Hristozov and Others  
v. Bulgaria, 2012, § 106). 
50.  In two very exceptional circumstances, the Court has accepted that the responsibility of the State 
under the substantive limb of Article 2 was engaged as regards the acts and omissions of health -care 
providers: firstly, where an individual patient ’s life was knowingly put in danger by a denial of access 
to life -saving emergency treatment ( Mehmet Şentürk and Bekir Şentürk  v. Turkey , 2013 ) and, secondly, 
where a systemic or structural dysfunction in hospital services resulted in a patient being deprived of access to life -saving emergency treatment where the authorities knew about or ought to have known 
about that risk and failed to take the necessary measures to prevent that risk from materialising, thus 
putting the patients ’ lives, including the life of the particular patient concerned, in danger ( Aydoğdu  
v. Turkey , 2016).  
51.  For the Court, in order for a case to be qualified as denial of access to life -saving emergency 
treatment, the following factors, taken cumulatively, must be met:  
 firstly, the acts and omissions of the health -care providers had to go beyond a mere error or 
medical negligence in that those health -care providers, in breach of their professional 
obligations, denied a patient emergency medical  treatment despite being fully aware that 
the person ’s life is at risk if that treatment is not given;  
 secondly, the impugned dysfunction had to be objectively and genuinely identifiable as 
systemic or structural in order to be attributable to the State au thorities;  
 thirdly, there had to be a link between the impugned dysfunction and the harm sustained;

RUSSIA""}","Guide on Article 2  of the Convention –  Right to life  
European Court of Human Rights  15/57 Last update: 31.08.2023   finally, the dysfunction must have resulted from the failure of the State to meet its obligation 
to provide a regulatory framework in the broader sense ( Lopes de Sousa Fernandes  
v. Portugal  [GC] , 2017, §§ 191-196).  
52.  The Court examined a number of cases raising issues of medical negligence and/or denial of access 
to treatment in hospital, such as:  
 administration of drugs to a disabled child despite his mother ’s opposition ( Glass  v. the 
United Kingdom  (dec.), 2003 ); 
 death of an elderly woman from bronchopneumonia ( Sevim Güngör  v. Turkey  (dec.), 2009 ); 
 death of a pregnant woman suffering from ulcerative colitis ( Z v. Poland, 2012 ); 
 death in hospital related to pulmonary complications  and patient ’s refusal to consent to 
treatment  (Arskaya  v. Ukraine , 2013 ); 
 death of a pregnant woman due to the doctors ’ refusal to carry out an urgent operation 
owing to her inability to pay medical fees ( Mehmet Şentürk and Bekir Şentürk  v. Turkey , 
2013) ; 
 death of a new- born baby in an ambulance after being refused admission to a number of 
public hospitals ( Asiye Genç  v. Turkey , 2015);  
 death after a heart attack caused by the administration of a drug ( Altuğ and Others  v. Turkey , 
2015) ; 
 death of the applicant ’s son in a hospital where unlicensed medical acts were carried out on 
him by doctors who lacked either the necessary licences or qualifications in violation of domestic law (Sarishvili- Bolkvadze  v. Georgia , 2018) . 
53.  In a number of cases the Court examined allegations of denial of access to medical treatment 
because of the refusal of the State to fully cover the costs of a particular form of conventional 
treatment. See, for  example, Nitecki  v. Poland (dec.), 2002 ; Pentiacova and Others  v. Moldova  (dec.); 
2005, Gheorghe  v. Romania (dec.), 2005 ; Wiater  v. Poland (dec.), 2012 . 
54.  In the case of Hristozov and Others  v. Bulgaria, 2012, where terminal cancer patients complained 
that they had bee n denied access to an unauthoris ed experimental drug, the Court did not find fault 
with the regulati ons governing access to such unauthoris ed medicinal products in situations where 
conventional forms of medical treatment appeared insufficient, and considered that Article 2 of the 
Convention could not be interpreted a s requiring access to unauthoris ed me dicinal products for 
terminally ill patients to be regulated in a particular way ( § 108).  
55.  Where applicants were unable to obtain access  to funds raised , in order to pay for the medical 
treatment abroad of their dy ing son , due to a statutory prohibition, the question whether Article 2 
was applicable was left open, since the Court found that, in any event,  having regard to the particular 
circumstances , there was no failure on the part of the State to comply with the requirements of that 
provision to protect life ( Pitsiladi and Vasilellis  v. Greece,  §§  54-55).  
56.  In Traskunova  v. Russia , 2022, the applicant ’s daughter died while she was participating in two 
sets of  clinical trials of a new drug for schizophrenia. T he Court emphasised the importance for 
individuals , who are facing risks to their health , to have access to information enabling them to assess 
those risks. In this regard, it considered that States were bound to adopt the necessary regulatory 
measures to ensure that doctors cons ider the foreseeable impact of a planned medical procedure on 
their patients ’ physical integrity and to inform patients of these consequences beforehand in such a 
way that the latter are able to give informed consent ( ibid, § 70). The Court underlined the need for 
persons with mental disabilities to enjoy heightened protection and that their participation in clinical 
trials be accompanied by particularly strong safeguards, with due account given to the particularities 
of their mental condition and its evolu tion over time ( Ibid,  79). On the facts of the case, the Court 
considered that the implementation of the regulatory framework was deficient and that the "

European Court of Human Rights  16/57 Last update: 31.08.2023  guarantees concerning informed consent of participants of clinical trials had not been complied with. 
It therefore found that the State had failed to protect the right to life of the applicant’s daughter, who 
was particularly vulnerable  (Ibid,  § 80). 
b.  Persons deprived of their liberty and vulnerabl e persons under the care of 
the State  
57.  The Court has emphasised the  right of all prisoners to conditions of detention which are 
compatible with human dignity, so as to ensure that the manner and method of execution of the measures imposed do not subject them to distress or hardship of an intensity exceeding the unavoidable level of suffering inherent in detention; in addition, besides the health of prisoners, t heir 
well- being also has to be adequately secured given the pr actical demands of imprisonment  (Dzieciak  
v. Poland, 2008, § 91). 
58.  The Court accepts that the medical assistance available in prison hospitals may not always be of 
the same standard as in the best medical institutions for the general public. Nevertheless, the State 
must ensure that the health and well -being of detainees are adequately secured by, among other 
things, providing them with the requisite medical assistance. The authorities must also ensure that 
the diagnoses and care are prompt and accurate, and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition, supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic 
strategy aimed at curing the detainee ’s diseases or preventing their aggravation ( Pitalev  v. Russia , 
2009, § 54). However, the Convention cannot be construed as laying down a general obligation to 
release detainees on health grounds ( Dzieciak  v. Poland, 2008, § 91). 
59.  Since  the State has direct responsibility for the welfare of persons deprived of their liberty, where 
such a person dies as a result of  a health  problem, the State must offer an explanation as to the cause 
of death and  the treatment administered to the person concerned prior to their death ( Slimani  
v. France , 2004, § 27; Kats and Others  v. Ukraine , 2008, § 104). 
60.  The Court has found fault in the medical treatment administered to persons deprived of t heir 
liberty when, for example:  
 the autho rities, despite been fully aware of his problems, failed to properly examine and 
provide medical treatment to a convict with c hronic illnesses ; the latter was transferred to 
a hospital belatedly and the su rgery he received was deficient.  He was discharged from 
hospital, despite the knowledge of the doctors that he needed immediate further surgery 
for his post -operative complications. They also withheld crucial details of his surgery and 
developing complications. The prison hospital staff treated him as an ordinary post -
operative patient rather than an emergency case with the consequence that surgery was performed too late. Furthermore, the prison hospital was not adequately equipped for dealing with massive blood loss ( Tarariyeva  v. Russia , 2006, §§ 88-89); 
 there was a lack of cooperation and co ordination between the various S tate authorities; a 
failure to transport the applicant to hospital for two scheduled operations, the lack of adequate and prompt information to the trial court on the applicant ’s state of health, the 
failure to secure him access to doctors during the final days of his life and the failure to take 
into account his health in the automatic extensions of his detentio n (Dzieciak  v. Poland , 
2008, § 101); 
 lack of medical attention  given  to a HIV -positive person suffering from numerous serious 
diseases; refusal to transfer her to a medical facility and refusal to examine her request for 
release promptly when her condition seriously deteriorated and subsequent belated release during which time she died of HIV -related diseases ( Kats and Others  v. Ukraine , 2008, 
§§ 105-112);  "

European Court of Human Rights  17/57 Last update: 31.08.2023   the treatment given to the first applicant, who had suffered from multi- drug resistant 
tuberculosis , was deficie nt because the diagnosis and treatment with second -line drugs was 
belated and the medical staff did not have the requisite expertise in the management of his 
illness ( Makharadze and Sikharulidze  v. Georgia , 2011, §§ 90-93). 
61.  The Court has adopted a similar approach in respect of the medical treatment of  vulnerable 
persons under the care of the State when  the domestic authorities , despite been  aware of the 
appalling conditions that later led to the death of persons placed in so cial care homes or hospitals,  
had nonetheless unreasonably put the lives of these people in danger  (see, in particular, Centre for 
Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC] , 2014, §§ 131 and 143 -144, which 
concerned the death of a young mentally disabled HIV positive Roma due to lack of adequate care, 
including medical care, in a ps ychiatric ho spital and, by contrast, Dumpe  v. Latvia  (dec.), 2021, §§ 56 
and 57, which concerned allegations of medical negligence in the care provided to  the applicant ’s son 
who was suffering from several serious illnesses in a State social care institution).  
5.  Protection of persons in the context of accidents  
62.  The Court has held that the positive obli gations under Article 2 require  States to adopt regulations 
for the prote ction of people ’s safety  in public spaces, and to ensure the effective functioning of that 
regulatory framework ( Ciechońska v. Poland, 2011, § 69; Banel  v. Lithuania, 2013, § 68). 
63.  In this respect, it could not be ruled out, that  in certain circumstances, the acts and omissions of 
the authorities in the context of po licies to ensure safety in public places could engage their 
responsibility under the substantive limb of Article 2 of the Convention. Nevertheless, where a Contracting State has  adopted an overall legal framework and legislation tailored to the different 
contexts with regard to public spaces, in order to protect the persons using them, the Court could not accept that matters such as an error of judgment on the part of an individu al player or negligent 
coordination among professionals, whether public or private, were sufficient of themselves to make 
a Contracting State accountable from the standpoint of its positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to protect life ( Marius Alexandru and Marinela Ștefan  v. Romania, 2020, § 100; Smiljanić  
v. Croatia , 2021, § 70). 
64.  The Co urt furthe r underlined that the positive obligation is not to be interpreted in such a way as 
to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability 
of human conduct and operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources 
(Ciechońska v. Poland, 2011, § 64; Marius Alexandru and Marinela Ștefan v. Romania, 2020, § 100). 
65.  Moreover, it recalled that the choice of means for ensuring the positive obligations under Article 
2 is in principle a matter that falls within the Contracting State ’s margin of appreciation. There are 
different avenues to ensure  Convention rights, and even if the State has failed to apply one particular 
measure provided by domestic law, it may still fulfil its positive duty by other means (Ciechońska  
v. Poland, 2011, § 65; Marius Alexandru and Marinela Ștefan v. Romania, 2020, § 102).  
66.  Ultimately, the question of whether there has been a failure by the State in its regulatory duties 
calls for a concrete , rather than an abstract,  assessment of the alleged deficiencies ( Marius Alexandru 
and Marinela Ștefan v. Romania, 2020, § 103 and Smiljanić  v. Croatia , 2021, § 72). 
67.  In the context of activities which may pose a risk to human life due to their inherently hazardous 
nature, such as activities carried out on construction sites, States are required to take reasonable 
measures to ensure the safety of individuals as necessary, including through regulations geared to th e 
special features of the activity ( Cevrioğlu  v. Turkey , 2016, § 57 with further references ). In particular, 
in the absence of necessary safety precautions, any construction site, especially one in  a residential 
area, has the potential for life -endangering accidents that may impact on not only professional 
construction workers, who are more familiar with the possible risks, but also on the public at large, "

v. Russia , 2020, § 28). 
68.  In a case which concerned allegations of deficiencies in the implementation of the regulatory 
framework concerning road safety, the Court underlined that the State ’s positive obligations in this 
context entailed, in the first  place , the obligation to have in place an appropriate set of preventive 
measures geared to ensuring public safety and minimizing the number of road accidents and, 
secondly, to ensure the effective functioning of those measures in practice ( Smiljanić  v. Croatia , 2021, 
§ 69). 
69.  The Court has found that the respondent State failed in its duty to protect the right to life  in: 
 Kalender  v. Turkey , 2009, § 49, which concerned the death of two people in a railway 
accident;  
 Banel  v. Lithuania, 2013, § 69, where the applicants ’ son died from injuries sustained when 
part of a balcony broke off from a building and fell o n him while he was  playing outsid e; 
 Cevrioğlu  v. Turkey , 2016, § 72, which concerned the death of the applicant ’s ten -year- old 
son who drowned after failing in to an uncovered water -filled hole on a construction site; see 
also Binnur Uzun and Others  v. Turkey , 2017, § 49, where the applicants ’ father fell down the 
shaft of a lift in a building the  construction  of which  had been abandone d. 
 Smiljanić  v. Croatia , 2021, § 85, where the applicant was killed in a traffic accident caused by 
a repeat offender driving under the influence of alcohol.  
70.  By contrast, t he Court found no failure on the part of the respondent State t o protect the right to 
life in:  
 Cecilia Pereira Henriques and Others  v. Luxembourg (dec.), 2003, where a labourer was killed 
in an accident at work when a wall of a building which was being demolished collapsed on 
top of him;  
 Furdík  v. Slovakia  (dec.), 2008, which concerned an emergency mountain -rescue operation;  
 Molie  v. Romania (dec.), 2009, § 47, which concerned a fatal accident in a school sport s 
facility;  
 Cavit Tınarlıoğlu  v. Turkey , 2016, § 107, which concerned life -threatening injuries sustained 
by the applicant , who was swimming in a bathing area that was not cordoned off, when he 
was struck by a motor boat . 
 Marius Alexandru and Marinela Ștefan v. Romania, 2020, § 109, which concerned a traffic 
accident due to a tree falling on the applicants ’ car while they were driving on a public main 
road.  
 Soares Campos  v. Portugal , 2020, § 172, which concerned the death of the applicant ’s son, 
who was swept out to sea while taking part on a beach in a gathering linked to a student tradition involving hazing activities.  
 Vardosanidze  v. Georgia , 2020, § 61, which concerned the death of the applicant ’s son  from 
carbon monoxide poisoning following reconnection of an improperly installed gas -operate d 
water heater despite a warning from gas company.  
D.  Temporal limitations  
1.  Beginning of life  
71.  Unlike Article 4 of the American Convention on Human Rights , which provides that the right to life 
must be protected “in general, from the moment of conception”, Article 2 of the Convention is silent "

European Court of Human Rights  19/57 Last update: 31.08.2023  as to the temporal limitations of the right to life and, in particular, does not define “everyone” ( “toute 
personne ”) whose “life” is protected by the Convention ( Vo v. France  [GC] , 2004, § 75). 
72.  The Court , having regard to the absence of any European consensus on the scientific and legal 
definition of the beginning of life, held that the issue of when the right to life begins comes within the 
margin of appreciation which it generally considers that States should enjoy in this s phere ( Vo 
v. France  [GC] , 2004, § 82). 
73.  In the case of  Vo v. France  [GC] , 2004, where the applicant had to undergo a therapeutic abortion 
as a result of medical negligence, the Court considered it unnecessary to examine whether the abrupt 
end to  the applicant ’s pregnancy fell within the scope of Article 2, seeing that, even assuming that 
that provision was applicable, there was no failure on the part of the respondent State to comply with 
the requirements relating to the preservation of life in the public -health sphere ( § 85; see also for a 
similar approach Mehmet Şentürk and Bekir Şentürk  v. Turkey , 2013, § 109).  
74.  In Evans  v. the United Kingdom  [GC] , 2007, where the applicant complained that British l egislation 
authoris ed her ex- partner to withdraw his consent to the storage and use of jointly created embryos, 
the Court found that, under English law , an embryo did not have independent rights or interests and 
could not claim – or have claimed on its behalf –  a right to life under Article 2 and that therefore the 
embryos in question did not have a right to life with in the meaning of Article  2 (§§ 54-56). 
2.  Issues related to end of life  
a.  Euthanasia  
75.  The Court has held that no right to die, whether at the hands of a third person or with the 
assistance of a public authority, can be derived from Article 2 of the Convention . It underlined that 
the consistent emphasis in all th e cases before it has been the obligation of the State to protect life 
(Pretty  v. the United Kingdom , 2002, § 39 and Mortier  v. Belgium , 2022, § 119). However, the Court 
further held  that the right to life enshrined under Article 2 could not be interpreted as per se  
prohibiting the conditional decriminalisation of euthanasia. However, in order to be compatible with Article 2, that decriminalisation had to be accompanied by suitable and sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse and thus secure respect for the right to life  ( Mortier v. Belgium , 2022, § § 138 -139) 
76.  In Mortier  v. Belgium  an act of euthanasia was performed on the applicant ’s mother, who had 
been  suffering  from chronic depression  for over forty years . The Court , when examining whether the 
State complied with their positive obligations to protect her life,  took into account the following 
elements: whether there was a legislative framework for pre -euthanasia procedures which met the 
requirements of Article 2; whether it had been complied with in the particular circumstances of the 
case ; and whether the post- euthanasia review mechanism afforded all the safeguards required by 
Article 2 ( § 141).  It emphasised that, in view of the complexity of this area and the lack of a Eur opean 
consensus, States had to be afforded a margin of appreciation, which  was not unlimited ( § 143). On 
the facts  of the case , the Court found no  violation of Article 2 as regards the legislative framework 
governing the pre -euthanasia procedure (§ § 155-156) and that the act in question had been 
performed in compliance with this procedure ( § 165). However, it found a violation as regards the 
post -euthanasia review mechanism, given the lack of independence of the specialised review board 
and the length of th e criminal investigation ( § 184).  
b.  Withdrawal of life -sustaining treatment  
77.  In the case of Lambert and Others  v. France  [GC],  2015, which concerned the decision of the 
authorities to discontinue nutrition and hydration allowing  a patient in state of total dependence to 
be kept alive artificially , the Court noted that no consensus existed among the Council of Europe 
member States in favour of permitting the withdrawal of artificial life -sustaining treatment, although "
14,19,"{""001-175359"": ""GARD AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM"", ""001-209750"": ""PARFITT v. THE UNITED KINGDOM""}","Guide on Article 2  of the Convention –  Right to life  
European Court of Human Rights  20/57 Last update: 31.08.2023  the majority of States a ppear to allow it. In this respect, it noted that while the detailed arrangements 
governing the withdrawal of treatment vary from one country to another, there was nevertheless a 
consen sus as to the paramount importance of the patient ’s wishes in the decision -making process, 
however those wishes are expressed. It therefore considered that in this sphere concerning the end 
of life, as in that concerning the beginning of life, States must be afforded a margin of appreciation, 
not just as to whether or not to permit the withdrawal of artificial life -sustaining treatment and the 
detailed arrangements governing such withdrawal, but also as regards the means of striking a balance between the pr otection of patients ’ right to life and the protection of their right to respect for their 
private lif e and their personal autonomy. The Court underlined, however, that this margin of 
appreciation is not unlimited and it reserves the power to review whethe r or not the State has 
complied with its obligations under Article 2 ( §§ 147-148). 
78.  In addressing the question of the administering or withdrawal of medical treatment, the Court 
takes into account the following elements: the existence in domestic law and practice of a regulatory framework compatible with the requirements of Article 2; whether account had been taken of the 
applicant ’s previously expressed wishes and those of the persons close to him, as well as th e opinions 
of other medical personnel and the possibility to approach the courts in the event of doubts as to the 
best decision to t ake in the patient ’s interest ( Gard and Others  v. the United Kingdom  (dec.),  2017,  
§ 83 and Parfitt  v. the United Kingdom  (dec.), 2021, § 37).  "
